## Info
        Here are my submissions to the hackathons I have participated in. 
### Locations and Placement
        VR hackathon placed 3rd "Hellothon"
          - Prompt was to create a hello world utilizing game engines/graphics. Our approach was create a 2.5D JS rendering
          that faked 3D appareance. I used Processing IDE and by using geomotry I was able to give the illution of 3D.
        
        Facial Recognition placed 1st place
          - Used a MERN-stack application (subsituted react with redux/react and embedded node into react) to call Mood-Me 
          and Kairos API's for there facial recognition.
